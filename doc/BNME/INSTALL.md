## How to install

1. Get latest release of BNME from [Releases](https://github.com/olanti-p/BNME/releases) section on GitHub or compile one yourself (see [COMPILING.md](COMPILING.md)).
2. Get release of BN that's compatible with that BNME release (should be mentioned in BNME release description on GitHub, otherwise just check git history).
   It must be a graphical release (with `tiles` in its name), curses is not supported.
3. Extract BN into an empty directory
4. Extract BNME into same directory, overwriting files when prompted
5. (Optional) Install additional external mods or tilesets
6. Run `cataclysm-bnme.exe` (or `cataclysm-bnme` if you're on Linux)
